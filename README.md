# LifeExpectancy-Corruption
This is a panel regression using various datasets from Kaggle. The objective was to measure the international effects of corruption and meat consumption on life expectancy.

# Datasets from Kaggle:
1. life_exp_worldbank.xlsx (https://www.kaggle.com/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete)
2. meat.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/meatconsumption)
3. merged_cpi_data (https://www.kaggle.com/jeegarmaru/corruption-perceptions-index-for-10-years)

# Results:
Increased meat consumption and corruption both decrease the life-expectancy. However, corruption is a negative feedback loop that can multiply the effects of meat consumption. 

# Seminar Paper:
Methodology and results are documented in paper accessable in respository.
